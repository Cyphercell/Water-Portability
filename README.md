# Water-Portability
This project predicts whether water is potable or not using ML . It includes data preprocessing, missing value handling, feature scaling and class imbalance handling using SMOTE-Tomek. Multiple models were compared and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning achieved slightly better performance and deployed using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
